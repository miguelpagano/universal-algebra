*** Formalization of Universal Algebra in Agda ***

This development corresponds to the formalization of concepts of
Universal Algebra in Agda, submitted to LSFA 2017.

This README file contains instructions to install agda and compile
the library, and a description of the modules.

** Installation **

This formalization was tested on Ubuntu with Agda 2.5.2 installed and
the standard library version 0.13.

* How to install (using cabal) agda and standard library in Ubuntu:

- Install emacs.
- Install 'happy' and 'alex' using apt-get:
  	  $ apt-get install happy alex
- Install 'cpphs' using cabal:
  	  $ cabal install cpphs
- Install 'agda' using cabal:
  	  $ cabal install agda
- Download the standard library version 0.13 from
  https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/archive/v0.13.tar.gz
- Unpack the tar.gz file to somewhere, say '~/opt/Agda/agda-stdlib-0.13'.
- Create the file '~/.agda/libraries' and put the text:
  	 ~/opt/Agda/agda-stdlib-0.13/standard-library.agda-lib
(replace folder '~/opt/Agda/agda-stdlib-0.13' if corresponds).
- Create the file '~/.agda/defaults' with the line:
  	 standard-library
- Edit file .emacs. Put the following text:
       	 (load-file (let ((coding-system-for-read 'utf-8))
                (shell-command-to-string "agda-mode locate")))

  	   

** Modules **

The formalization is modularized in these files:

- UnivAlgebra.agda
	Basic definitions of Heterogeneous Universal Algebra:
   	Signature, Algebra, Homomorphism, Congruence, Quotient, Subalgebra.
- Morphisms.agda
	Definitions of Homomorphism, Homo composition and equality,
        Isomorphism, Initial and Final Algebras, Homomorphic image and
	Kernel of a congruence.
- Setoids.agda
	Definitions and properties about setoids.
- HeterogeneousVec.agda
	Definition, operations and properties of heterogeneous vectors.
- IsoTheorems.agda
	Proofs of the three isomorphism theorems.
- TermAlgebra.agda
	Definition of the term algebra of a signature and proof of initiality.
- SigMorphism.agda
	Definition of derived signature morphisms and reduct algebras.
	Translation of terms and theories.
- Equational.agda
	Formalization of conditional equational logic: Signature with variables,
	equations, environments, proofs, models, proof of Birkhoff soundness and
	completeness.
- Examples
  -- EqBool.agda
	  Definition of two theories of bool algebras. Translation from one to another.
  -- Monoid.agda
          Definition of the theory of Monoids. Bijection between the standard library
	  definition of monoids and the universal algebra approach.
  -- Group.agda
	  Definition of the theory of Groups, extending theory of Monoids.
  -- CompilerArith.agda
          Development of a correct compiler of an arithmetic language to a stack-based
	  machine language, via Universal Algebra.
  -- GoguenMeseguer.agda
	  

** Type check  **

You can load a file in emacs and type-check this with the command "C-c C-l".
